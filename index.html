      <p>My post high school education began at the University of Utah in 2013. I had most of my generals out of the way
        due to the completion of the IB program and several AP classes offered through my high school. This
        unfortunately meant I didn't have much time to discover my passion in college before I was quickly
        thrust into classes specific to my declared major- a BS in Economics. It became evident to me pretty quickly
        that this wasn't the field I wanted to be in, and I became envious of my friends who had selected a path in
        Computer Science.</p>

      <p>I've always considered myself to be a problem solver, and a person that enjoys strategic reasoning and
        implementing complex ideas to accomplish tasks. Programming seemed like something that I could find great
        satisfaction in learning and pursuing as a potential career field.</p>

      <p>I began my journey into the world of coding in March of 2019. I started out with self teaching some syntax and
        various operators in Javascript. I found myself enjoying the challenge of learning new operations and
        wanted to find ways to apply this learning in a practical way. The University of Utah Coding Bootcamp seemed
        like a wonderful way to further my skills. Right out of the gates, the camp had us working with html and css,
        providing me with the skills to begin implementing my knowledge and actually creating.</p>

      <p>I am excited for what the future holds, and anxiously await the challenges that lie in store- and the skills that
        I will develop as I tackle them.</p>
